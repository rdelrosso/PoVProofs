# Presales PoV Proofs (Assets & Instructions)

MONGODB INC. INTERNAL ONLY - DO NOT PROVIDE THIS PROJECT'S CONTENT DIRECTLY TO PROSPECTS, CUSTOMERS OR THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY

The collection of instructions and assets to enable an SA to prove each of the [PoV Required Capability Proofs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywiL5h36GKHG0NpolMglNptlwdm2JCHfw4wgBRh1t38). For specific instructions on how to run each proof, click on the relevant proof label in the table below.

All these proofs are focused on the use of __Atlas only__, as the deployment target, to showcase our database, tools and cloud service capabilities together. If an SA needs to reproduce a subset of these proofs in an on-prem or cloud self-managed environment, it is the SA's own responsibility to extrapolate the Atlas oriented instructions into the variation required.
